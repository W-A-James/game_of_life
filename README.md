# Conway's Game of life

## Description

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The game has four basic rules

1. Any live cell with _fewer than two live neighbours_ dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with _two or three live neighbours_ lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with _more than three live neighbours_ dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with _exactly three live neighbours_ becomes a live cells, as if by reproduction
